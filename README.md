# üé® Color gradient designer

A simple javascript based color gradient designer for your browser.
Help's you create awesome gradients and generates the appropriate code for usage in your project via copy & paste or file download.
You can share the gradients as URL and save your favourites in a personal gallery.

## Documentation

### Gradient hash format

This section describes the encoding of gradients as used for the designer in the URL hash.  

It has the form `[name=][pos:]RRGGBB{-[pos:]RRGGBB}`  

The optional name in the form `name=` is followed by a list of nodes (at least one) separated by dashes `-`.
The `name` is an arbitrary string which may not contain an equals character `=`.
Each `node` is described by an optional position and mandatory color in the form `pos:RRGGBB` or `RRGGBB`.
The position percentage `pos` is a floating point number between 0.0 and 100.0.
The color `RRGGBB` is the hex color code where leading zeros may be omnitted.
Nodes with an explicit position are not required to be in correct order, but if multiple nodes have equal positions their order matters.
If one or multiple positions are omnitted, the affected nodes are equally distributed in the gap.

The normalized form (as generated by the program) states positions with one digit precision for either all or none of the nodes, ensures their correct order and outputs hex color codes with six characters.

Examples:
- [`0`](https://eltos.github.io/gradient#0) is a solid black (normlized form `000000`)
- [`FF0000-FF00-FF`](https://eltos.github.io/gradient#FF0000-00FF00-0000FF) is a uniform red-green-blue gradient (normalized form `FF0000-00FF00-0000FF`)
- [`stripes=33.33:FF0000-33.33:FF00-66.67:FF00-66.67:FF`](https://eltos.github.io/gradient/#stripes=33.33:FF0000-33.33:FF00-66.67:FF00-66.67:FF) is a red-green-blue stipe gradient named *stripes* (normalized form `stripes=33.3:FF0000-33.3:00FF00-66.7:00FF00-66.7:0000FF`)
- [`0-10:FFFFFF-30:0-60:FFFFFF-0`](https://eltos.github.io/gradient#0-10:FFFFFF-30:0-60:FFFFFF-0) is a black-white alternating gradient with increasing width (normalized form `0:000000-10:FFFFFF-30:000000-60:FFFFFF-100:000000`)
- [`default=0:093391-33:019C5C-56:ABCD39-64:BFD336-77:B7D135-100:84CE34`](https://eltos.github.io/gradient#default=0:093391-33:019C5C-56:ABCD39-64:BFD336-77:B7D135-100:84CE34) is a gradient named *default* (this is already in normalized form)
